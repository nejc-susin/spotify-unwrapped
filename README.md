# Spotify Unwrapped

A web application that creates personalized listening statistics and insights from your Spotify streaming history data.

This is a personal "weekend" project aimed at testing out AI-assisted programming. 


### How to Use

1. Request your Spotify data from [Spotify Privacy Settings](https://www.spotify.com/account/privacy/)
2. Once you receive your data, look for the streaming history json file (they might be split up into several files)
3. Upload the file through the web interface
4. Explore your listening statistics!
